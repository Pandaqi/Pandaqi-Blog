Welcome to my blog about game development!

**Who are you?** I'm Pandaqi 🐼. An indie game developer who mostly creates local multiplayer games for families ❤️. Check out the [game studio website](https://pandaqi.com).

**What does that mean?** I make games 🎮 for 1-4 players on the same phone/computer. Designed to be playable by children, parents, grandparents, non-gamers, anyone!

**What can I find here?** I usually write "devlogs" or "diaries" 📜 about every game I make. Within those, I share problems I faced, lessons I learned, choices I made (and why), and more.
