The original title for this article was "nobody becomes anything overnight". While true, I was afraid this would set the wrong tone or give the wrong impression. Because this article merely showcases my journey to becoming a game designer.

I will reveal my interesting flaws and successes, hopefully inspiring others _and_ showing the truth about what it means to become good at something.

Why? Well, this article started its life when I ran out of space around my work area.

Over the years, I've made numerous games, and the amount per year only seems to go up. Most of those games are _board games_, which means I have printed and cut physical materials. As it turns out, physical items take up _space_. 

When I made my first few games, I could easily stash them away in some random container. They were just a handful of cards, or a few playing boards printed on an A4 paper.

Until the pile grew to 10, 20, 30+ games and didn't fit anymore. Even worse, it was hard to find any game in this mess (whenever I wanted to show them or play them again), and their contents kept spilling out. Younger me didn't even have the patience to put an elastic or _something_ around the cards and tiles I cut out, which meant they were free to move all over my desk :p

Needless to say, I needed a better structure. 

That structure isn't the important part. (I simply bought some sorting boxes with variable divisions, so I can store a bunch of games neatly in one box. Revolutionary idea, I know. Buying storage boxes to store things.)

What's important is that I had to take out, look at, and clean up _aaaaaalll_ the games I made throughout my whole life. This gave me an opportunity to look back on all of them and hopefully say some interesting things.

All early games will have some Dutch text written over it. It took a while before I defaulted to creating games in English. I'll translate whenever it's important.

## Who are you?

I'm Pandaqi, or Tiamo Pastoor. A freelance artist who creates video games and board games (though mostly board games), writes books, creates music, and much more.

I'm not perfect by any means. In fact, I've never even had a game traditionally published. I call myself a game designer because I _design games_. (A lot, for a long time now.) Not because I have won awards, or think I'm amazing at it, or whatever.

I _do_ know that I am a much better designer than I was five, ten, twenty years ago. I know I've learned a lot, I know many of my mistakes are common across new game designers, and I know the things I make now are consistently good-looking and somewhat fun.

This article simply chronicles my process until the current day.

## High School

The earliest games I can show you are from when I was at high school. I know there are a few earlier games, but they are lost to time. 

(I was probably the only kid at elementary school who was part of the "board game club" in our village. I was certainly the only _kid_ who was a member of that club.)

### Maps & Cards

I basically had an obsession with two things: _maps_ and _PokÃ©mon_.

Every game I made was either ...

* A card game with made-up creatures and attacks
* Or some tile-laying game in which you build a railroad or network or whatever. (I also drew a lot of fantasy maps at the time, and I honestly became quite skilled at drawing that particular kind of map from imagination.)

Below are images from two of those card games. The first game was from the _start_ of high school, the second near the _end_ of high school.

@TODO: IMAGE
- That weird card game with Avatar backgrounds
- The prettier card game with animals

You can clearly see the progression in terms of graphics and design. I can't really speak to the game itself, because first of all those cards are _completely unreadable_, and secondly I lost the rulebook.

I can't remember ever playing the first game with someone. 

I _do_ remember playing the second one---it's easier to get people playing when it _looks_ somewhat good---and getting my first taste of "testing will reveal a thousand flaws you never saw coming". I remember the cards leading to a stalemate or locked game half the time. In other words, if a certain combination of cards was played, the game literally _could not continue_ according to the rules.

As expected, I abandoned these projects rather quickly.

Below is an example of such a tile-laying game about creating roads.

@TODO: IMAGE of Sint-themed road game

For those who are confused, it is themed around a Dutch cultural thing called St. Nicholas (_Sinterklaas_), which means I probably made it especially for that event. (It's basically Christmas but a few weeks earlier and with some other questionable changes. In any case, gifts are involved, hence the gift icons.)

Again, no rulebook in sight, but these tiles clearly paint a picture of the general game idea. Place roads, connect stuff, get points. We must've played this on the night itself, but I can't remember any of that. Anyway, also abandoned and probably really bad.

As you can see, during this period I already did a mix of hand-drawn prototypes and digital graphics. I had played so many board games that I had a general _idea_ of what a good game looked like. I knew you could do fun stuff with tiles and networks. I knew you could create cool games with cards. But I was certainly not skilled enough to actually _do_ that.

It might be hard to believe when looking at the images above, but I focused 90% on _graphics_ and only 10% on game design. Which is another reason why I only have the cards and not a rulebook for these games.

### Going bigger

Are we done with St. Nicholas? Of course not!

With my new graphical prowess, 15-year-old me obviously thought I could make a _professional_ game now.

I decided to use _The Game Crafter_ to create an actual box, with actual cards, and actual components. I also somehow convinced my parents to financially back me up on this one, which was a bad idea in all possible ways, as the eventual cost of this game ... well let's not talk about.

Anyway, a third obsession reveals itself: _Werewolf_ (or _Mafia_).

To this day, the idea of Werewolf still feels strong to me. Hidden role game, with tension and betrayal, playable with just some cards, playable with big groups. Now that I'm older, however, I must say there are plenty flaws and downsides in that game and I wouldn't quickly play it again. That said, I am _still_ regularly trying to find a set of rules or ideas that would create a "better werewolf". (Some of those ideas are literally labeled "werewolf but better?")

So what did I do? I repurposed famous characters from the St. Nicholas "lore" as hidden roles in a Werewolf-inspired game.

@TODO: IMAGE of gekleurde pieten van Nederland

In keeping with the trend, we only played this thing once, and it wasn't even that night. A few years later my mother found the box again and said "we paid so much for this, surely we should play it!"

And we did. And it ... kinda worked?

This is the first game where I really focused on the gameplay and the rulebook as well. The first project I actually _finished_! 

It was certainly playable. I wouldn't call it _good_ or _an improvement over Werewolf_. After that evening, I immediately wrote a second version of the rules. (At this time, I was 22 years old I believe.) With my experience, it was easy to see all the flaws and simplify the rules.

Still, it showed some potentially unique ideas.

* People also had _day_ roles (besides their night roles). These were clearly separate, but did influence each other in fun ways.
* The night actions mostly consisted of _stealing wooden components_ from the center of the table. I thought this would add some stealth and extra strategy. It, again, _kinda_ worked.
* The day roles, however, took too much time and would slow down the whole game. While most roles were certainly _interesting_ and could be used for strategy, they were just too convoluted and slow. (They also required way too much material. This game has _so many different chips and tokens and what not_!)

The imagery was quite clear. The rulebook wasn't half bad. And, as I said, I actually _finished the game_ and it was _playable_. 

Those might seem like obvious requirements for a game---and they are---but achieving this was a major milestone. Making games is hard. Learning how to do all the parts well is hard. Compare this game with what I made just ~5 years prior and it's a world of difference. 

I think everybody who designs their first game will create an incoherent mess with contradicting rules, which they'll abandon way before it's done. It's just part of the process of becoming a better designer.

So what did I learn? The price of this _one print_ and the complexity of it all basically taught me to _simplify_ and become more _minimalist_. This should have been my peak when it comes to complexity, but as it happens with stubborn teenagers fumbling around, I only really learned these lessons a few years later ...

## Start of university

### Tower of Zero

Near the end of high school, during a long break (because many teachers had fallen ill that day), I basically made up a whole card game with a girl sitting next to me. It was a weird day, but it was fun and exciting to just _create_ something and immediately test it, and to do it together.

I met her again at the start of university and we recalled this moment. That convinced me to cycle home and work on the "official version" of that game right away!

At the end of the weekend, I had created "Tower of Zero: Ultimate Edition". (Yes, we're finally naming projects now.)

@TODO: IMAGE of Tower of Zero

As you can see, the graphics received a boost in some ways, but degraded (compared to the previous project) in other ways. (I clearly hadn't figured out that things should be at a high resolution when printing.)

This is common. Many people think that learning or progress is a straight line, always going up, but it's absolutely not. Sometimes you happen to do better, sometimes you just happen to do worse. You have good days and bad days. You have challenging projects and projects that really suit you and flow easily.

I remember really struggling with trying to make these cards look good and keeping the text legible. I just didn't know how. The game had no "theme" to anchor to---it's just an abstract card game about numbers. I'd never done something in this vein before, so I gave it my best shot and that was that.

That said, these cards are certainly _playable_ and they are more consistent and minimal than anything I did before. The whole game is just this one deck of cards in the same style.

The rules were also better than anything I'd done before. (I actually printed and kept the rulebook! Hurray!) They are still too long to explain completely here, but the general gist is ...

* On your turn, you play a number one above or below the current one.
* If you're ever able to play a "0" on a pile, you win the game.
* To make this work, the "0"-s all have different unique rules for when they may be played, and other numbers mess with the pile a lot.
* The most common actions are things that _split_ and _merge_ piles, and things that force you to give cards away or steal cards.

We're still in the stage, however, of "the rules work but it's not great". The explanation above is quite simple and the game _can_ be really fun and quick. But it's mostly just random and luck-based. Again, I barely played this with anyone, because it's just _not that fun after the first time_.

### Coup & Resistance

This is also the period in which I started imitating (or simply copying) existing games. Partially because it makes _great_ training, partially because I wanted to play those games but didn't have the money to buy them.

I probably copied more, but the ones I clearly remember are Coup and The Resistance. Unfortunately, I threw away my own Resistance artwork once we got the real game. But I still have Coup!

@TODO: IMAGE of COUP

As I said, this was mostly training. I saw this as an opportunity to practice painting some animals and gold tokens. (I simply repurposed the characters from the game as random animals.)

But I _do_ remember playing this quite a lot with others. 

It's a clear indicator that _Coup_ is a really good game, and my own games at that time were not :p

That's another thing I've learned. Whenever I tested a new game of mine, I obviously asked what people thought of it and whether they had any critique. Most people think you're supposed to be "nice", so they lie and say "no it was fine!"

Don't! That's completely useless! If a creative person asks for your feedback, give them your actual feedback.

Anyway, I learned to simply _read_ other signs. When the game is good, people want to play another round. They maybe even _assume_ we're going to play another round and already shuffle the deck. If it's not, people immediately stand up once the game is done.

Similarly, a bad game prompts no discussion. We test it, it's not great, I never hear anything about it again. I know a game is _good_ when, two days later, one of the people with whom I tested suddenly goes "you know what you should do? Add a monkey to that card game that can do action X!"

It shows it was fun and interesting enough that people thought about it and want to say something about it.

(The third sign is obviously just ... enjoyment. Laughter. Funny jokes. Active participation in the game.)

Studying the art and rules of famous (good) games, and trying to copy or imitate them myself, was a _great_ learning tool. 

There's this stigma around using references or imitating others. I think that's a terrible influence on all the creative people in this world. I wish I'd copied and imitated, without shame or hesitation, much more and much earlier in my development. 

As with most creative people, I automatically reached a point (after perhaps a handful of imitated games) at which I wanted to deviate and add my own ideas again. There's really no danger here of truly getting stuck blatantly copying others ideas your whole life. (Not if you're in it for the creativity and the games, as opposed to money or easy success.)

### More network games!

After the previous phase, I went on a rampage creating games all about networks and travel again :p Returning to my first love and all that.

I created three in quick succession, each one better than the other. (On my Dutch blog, which was my only website at the time, I named these "spiritual successors" of each other.)

@TODO: Scheve Schapenschutters

@TODO: Slingerende Schoten

@TODO: NaÃ¯vigatie

What drew me to these games? I guess it was the _randomness_ and _variety_, combined with that minimalism I was searching for.

I've apparently always been annoyed that (great) board games only had _one_ fixed board. Only one world, one layout, and that's all you get. 

With tile-based games (which combine to create a network), every game has a completely different world! As you play those games shown above, you keep adding more tiles to the world, creating an entirely different layout/network each time.

Additionally, those games were (mostly) a deck of tiles and nothing else. Not a bunch of different tokens/decks/whatever, just _one consistent type of material_. Minimal and simple.

This is the point at which I finally focused on _game mechanics_. All these games have a great rulebook with lots of images, examples, etcetera. All of these games have actually been tested several times and improved upon.

Again, you may think "duh, of course you test your games and give examples in the rules!" 

But it's not that obvious, or easy, or even _possible_. Especially not when you're still very much a beginner designing your first few games. (Even counting the games I'm pretty sure I made but lost somewhere, these were only my ... 10th game and up?)

With every project you make, you overcome _one_ flaw. You improve _one_ aspect. You make _one_ fewer mistake. 

A beginning game designer will not worry about a neat rulebook if they haven't even figured out how to put legible text on a card. It's one step at a time, and only now did I arrive at the step of "test and iterate on a good rulebook".

With the exception of the sheep game (the first one), these games can actually still be played today! They are on my Pandaqi website, which I'll talk about soon. I deemed the sheep game too bad to put online, while the others are "acceptable and maybe fun for some". (Additionally, the sheep game was in a format that made it really hard to translate to English and share.)

The "Swerving Shots" game was the first game I ever introduced to and tested with my friends, with whom I held regular game nights at the time. (We still do, just less regular now that we're boring _adults_ with _work to do_ and stuff.) 

My friends are smart. I've studied Mathematics, and people always called me a genius, but let me tell you: I seem a dumb stumbling fool compared to all my friends (and classmates) at university.

As such, just one test game with them immediately prompted five smart ways to improve the game. It really _showed_ the power of testing games with other people, especially those who previously had no clue that you were even working on the game. They bring a fresh perspective and solve issues on which you've been stuck for a while. (Also, pick really smart playtesters, it helps.)

But what does an "improvement" mean? How do you improve rules? During this period, as I iterated on basically the same core design, I gained more wisdom in this area.

* Simpler is always better. Try to keep everything focused on _one_ system. Try to solve multiple problems with _one_ rule.
* Try radical changes. Only changing one minor thing and then playing again won't really tell you anything. Best case scenario, it will only bring you towards the better rules _really slowly_.
* Look for the fun. "Clever" rules, or mechanics, or systems, or balancing ... is all worthless if people aren't having fun.
* Don't expect people to keep _anything_ in their head. Reduce the overhead, reduce the mental calculation. Put everything _on the board_ (or _on the cards_), at all times, as reminders.

The list could go on and on. Every test of these games revealed other major flaws that have taught me lessons I still use to this day.

I guess the biggest lesson is that it's valuable to pick _one idea_ and _iterate on it_ for several games in a row. It allows you to gain much deeper knowledge for once, instead of broadening your knowledge.

The last game---Naivigation---is fine as it stands, but I've always known that it hides a true _gem_ of a game. So it's always been my plan to revamp it. The idea is strong, the execution just okay.

That's another lesson. When you're just starting out, most of your ideas or intuition will be right, it's just that the _execution_ is severely lacking. As such, I think it's smart to pick your first projects based on what you can _execute_, not based on how good you think the idea is. Otherwise you'll get frustrated and give up, because the idea is _so good_ but you just can't _get it to work_!

My ideas folder is filled with things I came up with yesterday ... and things I came up with 15+ years ago. Yes, newer ideas are generally more refined and "fully cooked". But some of my oldest ideas still seem brilliant and I want to find the time to make them one day.

Conclusion:

What I hope this article shows, is that getting good at something is a long process of just _doing it_. Trying, failing, trying again. I made many, many games. The early ones were mostly abandoned, terrible, ugly, simply unplayable. But with each one, I got slightly better.

And you will be discouraged from time to time. Either by your own doubt and frustration, or by others critiquing you. Like many creatives, I've heard it all before. How my ideas were weird and wouldn't work, how I couldn't draw or pick colors to save my life, how I should find something I was good at, how I should get a real job, how my games were complicated and people didn't want to test them anymore, etcetera.

And you know what? They were right! As the images showed, my first designs were murder on the eyes! My rules were so bad games couldn't even be finished and I never even saved the rulebooks.

You take it all in. You sift through the information and pick the things that seem useful or instructional to you. And you try to make a better game next time.
