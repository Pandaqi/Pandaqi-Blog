Write about creating my own level editor for "Letters against Loneliness".

Why that is sometimes really nice and useful, but sometimes not worth your time.

(Because, for example, something like Godot or Defold has a built-in interface that makes stuff very easy.)

HOWEVER, I would vote for a resounding YES eventually. Why? Because the most important thing, I've noticed, is to test things very quickly and as early as possible. 

If you make a level editor where you can add some element within a few minutes, then build levels with it (again in a few minutes), you can easily see which mechanics work and which don't. (Before putting more work into them or locking them into place.)
