This page contains all devlogs related to _boardgames_. 

Sometimes they are split in a regular devlog (about design decisions and the process) and a technical devlog (about algorithms, code problems, technical issues).

This includes my hybrid games: boardgames with a digital component, usually my game studio website. (Unless the game has so many digital elements that I'd rather call it, you know, a _videogame_.)
