"The Pirate Games" are a collection of games with the same core mechanic and pirate theme. (Which I, very creatively, called _the pirate games_)

These are "deduction games". All players get unique hints about some puzzle (say, where a treasure is located). Then they must figure out the hints of the other players by, well, playing the game in a smart way.
