The Outnumbered Series are a collection of simple card games that all revolve around _one unique number_. For example, in Nine Lives, you start with ... nine lives and must not be the first to lose them all. They all provide a simple twist on how to deal with that number and either use it or lose it, creating math-based card games for the whole family.
