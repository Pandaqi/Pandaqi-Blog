The Swiftsmash Saga is a collection of games about being the first to _smash_ (or just tap/grab/get) the right or wrong card. They're simple party games about quick-thinking and dexterity, where the rules about _what_ to smash (or when) constantly change, and you have to keep up _or_ bend them in your favor.
