The Throneless Games is a collection of 4 games that all use the simple "Throneless Mechanic" (vote simultaneously, and either win votes for your secret loyalty, or swap places with someone), but take it in completely different directions for unique games.

The project was not originally set up to be a "project" (just 1 game, maybe a "sequel"), which is why the devlogs don't start referencing other games until very late.
