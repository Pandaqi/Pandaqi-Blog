This category contains everything related to my "One Week Games".

That description is actually completely false. Most of these games were _not_ made in a week. But I started this challenge to force myself to keep projects small and finish them. When I say "this will take a week", it will take a month. And finishing a (relatively large) game within a month is also a good thing.

I'm keeping the name anyway, because I also have One Paper Games, and One Button Games. It's apparently my branding.
