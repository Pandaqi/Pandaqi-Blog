If you don't know about the project yet, visit the official page: [The Peerful Project---Free Local Multiplayer Games](https://pandaqi.com/the-peerful-project)

I also wrote an in-depth article series about [How I Created "Pizza Peers"](https://pandaqi.com/blog/videogames/the-peerful-project/pizza-peers/devlog-pizza-peers/1-how-i-created-pizza-peers/). It covers many of the same topics and
ideas, and actually shares the code I used, in case you want to create
your own games like these. 

For years now, I've been thinking about ways to create *accessible local
multiplayer games*.

Everyone I know loves these games ... but only once you've
somehow managed to convince them to try one.

Everyone has different obstacles and excuses: 
* "But I don't understand controllers"
* "But our computer isn't good enough"
* "But I don't have money for those expensive games/controllers/consoles"
* "But games are too hard"
* "But I'm not that competitive"
* "But I'm not into gaming"
* ...

Creating and playtesting games for years showed me that these concerns
-- for the most part -- were valid. Games (and the necessary
hardware/devices for multiplayer) *are* expensive, and oftentimes
complex and intimidating to the non-initiated.

The solution
------------

Until, a few weeks ago, something clicked.

Everyone around me had no problem playing the **Jackbox** games. Even
those who did not like or play any games.

The Jackbox games are social party games, which you start on the
computer, but require each player to play on their own smartphone. One
of their biggest hits was "Drawful": you draw something on your phone,
all pictures are displayed on the big screen, people must guess what
they represent.

Apparently, using smartphones solved the issues. People already had a
smartphone. They used it, understood it, were maybe even a little
addicted to it.

So I thought: **what if we use smartphones as *controllers* for games?**

The Jackbox games are mostly turn-based. You only press a button/draw
something/type something occasionally. Signals are somewhat delayed, but
it doesn't matter.

I wanted to see if a *real(time)* game was possible. One where you could
use your smartphone like a controller, as if you were playing an actual
game. Constant input, instant feedback, all that good stuff.

After many search sessions and experimental (mostly failed) games, I
finally found the solution.

I dubbed that solution **"The Peerful Project"**.

What is The Peerful Project?
----------------------------

It's a **collection of free local multiplayer games**, which can be
accessed in your **browser**, and which use your **smartphone** as the
controller.

The game is hosted on a computer (or any big screen that is visible to
all players). You simply open the browser, type the URL, and click
"Create Game!"

Once the game is created, people can type the same URL on their phone,
join the game, and you're already playing.

The games can be anything, so long as browsers (and smartphones) are
capable enough to run it.

Updates are immediate. I've found that players forget after a few
seconds that they are actually playing over the internet and are
actually holding a phone. By that time, they are in a flow, playing the
game like they would any other.

Why should anyone care?
-----------------------

As stated above, my goal is to help hesitant people overcome that first
hurdle. I estimate that nearly 90%-95% of people thoroughly enjoyed the
(cooperative) multiplayer games I made them play, yet it was a struggle
every time to convince them.

(My mother took three or four tries before she finally admitted: "okay,
now that I can work with the controller, these games are actually a lot
of fun!")

Additionally, I want to make people play games *together*. These days, I
find the world is growing lonelier and more isolated by the minute. Yet,
everyone agrees that *love*, *friendship*, and undertaking fun
activities with your loved ones are what brings happiness. They always
say "I wish I could spend more time with family" or "".

So why doesn't everyone play boardgames or computer games? Why pass on
such great opportunities? I want to create games that facilitate and
encourage these great social and loving movements, and that's why I'm
making this project.

Okay, so why is this better than other games?
---------------------------------------------

This system has tons of **advantages**:

-   Free

-   Quick and easy to start, no matter your hardware or situation. (It's
    literally 5-10 seconds to start and connect.)

-   Forces games to be simple, elegant, and accessible to anyone. (I
    will explain below that it's hard to make anything that's truly big
    or complex.)

-   Supports nearly any player count without problems (solo games are
    fine, inviting ten players to your party is fine, so long as they
    all bring their own smartphone)

-   Still plays like a real game and can do (almost) all of the same
    things

-   The smartphone even offers **additional functionality**: for
    example, I can change the screen to match a situation in the game.
    Or I could use the *shaking* mechanism in phones for gameplay
    elements.

Surely there are disadvantages?
-------------------------------

Of course, there are **disadvantages**:

-   It's only *local* multiplayer. So no playing together with your
    distant relative who lives on the other side of the world.

-   There are certain limits (in terms of performance and possibilities)
    on browsers and smartphones.

-   Creating a (good) game this way is *hard*. You need to setup the
    right signals, create two separate interfaces (computer and
    smartphone), balance the game for all player counts, et cetera.

-   A personal disadvantage: I cannot earn income from it, as it's just
    a tiny website, and it's near impossible to prevent people from just
    copying everything.

If you want cutting-edge games, or very large and complex games, or you
don't want to meet with people in real life -- by all means, choose a
different game.

Otherwise, I think the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, and
early (play)tests support this.

What kind of games can we expect?
---------------------------------

I am quite experimental -- as the existence of this project shows -- but
not necessarily in the way you'd expect.

All games are *family games*, suitable for all ages. Accessibility is a
key point, with simplicity and elegance being one of my top priorities.
(I must admit, though, that this is really hard and I'm still learning.)

These games always support many player counts. (This is a habit I picked
up because I come from a large family.) Regularly, they offer a solo
mode as well.

All parts of the game are custom made -- art assets, music and
soundtrack, any special game systems, everything. It makes the game more
cohesive, allows me great freedom and flexibility, and I always want to
learn and improve.

I also, however, need to be *innovative* in some way to motivate myself
for a project. Each game I make needs to do one *really special thing*,
which is usually also the "hook" or the "elevator pitch" that sells the
game.

For example: I have an idea for a hidden role game. Some players are
thieves, some are police. There's one shared screen, which is the map of
a city. But on everybody's individual smartphone, they get another
screen that shows what's around them. Thieves try to hide from the
police and steal without getting caught, the police tries to catch them.
Meanwhile, you can send secret chat messages to other players on your
phone as well, to coordinate your strategies!

Another example: I have an idea for a game based on *sound*. You need to
judge based on sound (volume, direction, pitch, etc.) where you are and
what is happening. Maybe you can even walk around the room (with your
phone in your hand) to explore and hear different parts.

I don't know if these ideas work. I need to try them out, which means
sometimes a whole month is "wasted". But if they work, man, it's awesome
:)

How often can we expect games?
------------------------------

As I write this, there's only a single game in the project ("Pizza
Peers"). That was my test game, my experiment to see if the concept was
even *possible*, let alone *fun and accessible*.

Luckily, the concept proved worthy!

I have at least five strong game ideas outlined at the moment, which I
will be creating whenever I have time to spare. I honestly think these
kinds of games are the future, and I am very excited about the
possibilities.

Creating Pizza Peers took me 2 weeks (including marketing, art, custom
soundtrack, etc.) working fulltime. I suspect other games take 1-2
months, working on them beside my regular job and studies.

Where does the name come from?
------------------------------

The technology used by these games is called **peer-to-peer**.

Essentially, it establishes a *direct* connection between your phone and
your computer. As long as you're on the same Wi-Fi, or relatively close
to each other, this means it only takes \<10ms to send and receive
signals. That's quick enough to never be noticeable.

What other technologies do you use?
-----------------------------------

Here's a quick overview:

-   Node.js for the server side.

-   A (free) server from Heroku.

-   The Phaser.io library for creating browser games.

-   Default HTML/CSS/JavaScript for creating the webpages and some of
    the interactive elements.

-   And standard Web Sockets for making your first connection to the
    game server.

The source code for all games in the project is online, so you can check
out any parts for yourself.

Conclusion?
-----------

Well, eh, play these games!

Or just play more local multiplayer games in general!

If you have trouble convincing people, try my games, or tell them "it's
cooperative; we win and lose together!" (almost always works)

If you have ideas for the project, never hesitate to tell me.

If you have other feedback or find bugs, also let me know.

I am but one man, I cannot test everything. I am also a mere human,
which means I make mistakes.

Support me
----------

**If you like this project**, please support me by donating, or buying
some of my work, or simply *sharing* the news with other people.

I earn no income from all these games. It's a passion project. I also
refuse to add advertisements or things like that, *especially* because
these are family games and kids will be playing them. Yet, it costs a
significant amount of time and money to create these games and keep them
online.

So any help is greatly appreciated.
