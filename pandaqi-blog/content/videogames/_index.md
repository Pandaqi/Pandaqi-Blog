This section contains all my devlogs related to _videogames_.

Sometimes they are split in a regular devlog (about design decisions and the process) and a technical devlog (about algorithms, code problems, technical issues).

These are mostly standalone, downloadable, local multiplayer games for desktop. But I always like to try new things: mobile/web games, single player, a _try_ at online multiplayer.
