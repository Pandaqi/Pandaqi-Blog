This section contains all my devlogs for my _bigger, professional, commercial releases_.

This means the devlogs are often muuuuch longer, and I'm less hand-wavy or loosey-goosey about many parts of the development process. Otherwise, they're pretty identical to the other devlogs. I'm honest about every part, I have no secrets, I'll share whatever I can.
