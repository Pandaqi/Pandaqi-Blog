# Pandaqi Blog

This is the full source code / project behind [Pandaqi Blog](https://pandaqi.com/blog/).

It's made using Hugo, which means it's a static website that I can generate and upload once in a while.

The actual website is inside `pandaqi-blog`, everything else is metadata or supportive documents for the project.

I mostly use it for devlogs about projects I released, but there are also some reviews, updates, and other miscellaneous articles.

Nothing is hidden or changed for this public version. In fact, you'll find many articles planned to release in the future, if you know where to look ;) 

I'm open sourcing all my websites in an effort towards an open world based on sharing and transparency. It's the least I can do.
